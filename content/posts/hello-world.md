Welcome to the LMF Blog.

This is a space where I'll share thoughts, updates, and insights about artificial intelligence, the technology landscape, and the projects we're working on.

## Why a blog?

The [Learn Guide](https://learn.logge.top) is great for timeless educational content—explaining concepts like attention mechanisms, tokenization, or how quantization works. But AI moves fast. Models that were state-of-the-art six months ago are now outdated. Benchmarks shift. New techniques emerge.

A blog gives us a place to capture the ephemeral: current model comparisons, industry developments, and real-world observations that have a shelf life.

## What to expect

- **Model updates**: When significant new models drop, I'll share practical takes on what matters
- **Technical deep dives**: Going beyond the Learn Guide with implementation details and experiments
- **Industry observations**: Thoughts on where AI is heading and what it means for builders
- **Project updates**: News about LMF projects and tools

## The philosophy

Minimal. Focused. No fluff.

The same approach we take with the Learn Guide applies here: clear explanations, practical insights, and respect for your time.

Thanks for reading. More soon.
